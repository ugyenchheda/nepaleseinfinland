Custom theme developed by Ugyen.
* A modern workflow with a pre-made command-line interface to turn your project into a more pleasant experience.
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php`. Just add the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/template-functions.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample layouts in `sass/layouts/` made using CSS Grid for a sidebar on either side of your content. Just uncomment the layout of your choice in `sass/style.scss`.
Note: `.no-sidebar` styles are automatically loaded.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Full support for `WooCommerce plugin` integration with hooks in `inc/woocommerce.php`, styling override woocommerce.css with product gallery features (zoom, swipe, lightbox) enabled.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
